# Recommended Phase Breakdown
## Phase 1: Database Foundation
Test database connection, models, and CRUD operations first since everything depends on this.
What to build:

database/ folder complete functionality
config/settings.py (database parts only)
Simple test script in run.py

Why first: Database issues are the most annoying to debug later. Get the foundation rock-solid.
Test approach: Hard-code some words, test all CRUD operations, verify connection pooling.

## Phase 2: Slack Integration
Test Slack posting, thread creation, and webhook reception.
What to build:

slack_integration/slack_client.py complete
config/settings.py (Slack parts)
Webhook handling in run.py

Dummy/hard-code: Use dummy word data, dummy database responses in Phase 1 format.
Test approach: Post test words, create threads, send replies, verify webhook parsing.

## Phase 3: LLM Word Generation
Test OpenAI integration and word generation logic.
What to build:

llm_backend/word_generator.py
llm_backend/prompts.py
config/settings.py (OpenAI parts)

Dummy/hard-code: Use real database from Phase 1, dummy Slack responses.
Test approach: Generate words, verify uniqueness, test prompt variations.

## Phase 4: Integration & Orchestration
Connect everything together with the orchestrator and tutor.
What to build:

llm_backend/orchestrator.py
llm_backend/tutor.py
llm_backend/main.py
Final run.py

## Why This Breakdown Works Better

Database first - Most projects fail on data layer issues. Get this bulletproof early.
Slack second - External API integrations are the second biggest source of bugs. Isolate and test thoroughly.
LLM third - Once you know database and Slack work, LLM integration becomes much easier to debug.
Integration last - With all components tested individually, integration becomes mostly plumbing.

## Testing Strategy Per Phase
Each phase should have a simple test mode in run.py
